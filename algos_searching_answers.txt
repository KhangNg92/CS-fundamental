3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
 - 7

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
 - 2

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
 - I would definitely use the linear search since it's unsorted

PROGRAMMING QUESTION:

1.  You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

    FUNCTION wordLookup (dictionary,word) 
 	SET firstword and lastword;       
	IF lastword < firstword THEN
            RETURN "can't find"

        SET midWord to ROUNDDOWN((lastWord-firstWord) / 2) + firstWord
        IF dictionary[midWord] = word THEN
            RETURN midWord
        ELSE IF word < dictionary[midWord].word THEN
            CALL wordLookup WITH dictionary, word, firstWord, midWord - 1 RETURNING result
            RETURN result

        ELSE
            CALL findWord WITH dictionary, word, midWord + 1, lastWord RETURNING result
            RETURN result
            
    END FUNCTION
