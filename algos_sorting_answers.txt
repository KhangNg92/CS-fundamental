procedure bubbleSort( list : array of items )

   loop = list.count;
   
   for i = 0 to loop-1 do:

            /* swap them */
            swap( list[j], list[j+1] )		 
            swapped = true
         end if
         
      end for
      
      /*if no number was swapped that means 
      array is sorted now, break the loop.*/

function partitionFunc(left, right, pivot)
   leftPointer = left
   rightPointer = right - 1

   while True do
      while A[++leftPointer] < pivot do
         //do-nothing            
      end while
		
      while rightPointer > 0 && A[--rightPointer] > pivot do
         //do-nothing         
      end while	
      if leftPointer >= rightPointer
         break
      else                
         swap leftPointer,rightPointer
      end if
   end while 
   swap leftPointer,right
   return leftPointer
end function

The reason why merge sort and quick sort are much more efficient than the others are both of them break the collection into sub-collections and sorts each sub-collection which save a lot of time to sort through the array.

4. 

Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm
