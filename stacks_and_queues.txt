1. The Stack data structure arranges elements in LIFO priority and Queue data structure arranges elements in FIFO priority.

2. Both of them handle the data flow. Queues are more common.

3. I'd use the LIFO for the UNDO because it'll replace the last element that I've just type
  - I'd use the FIFO for the REDO because it'll be the first element created and it's the first one to leave. It'd be used to add a change back to the element that's already done.

PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS

1. function reverseString(str) {
  newarr = str.split("");
  result = [];
  x = newarr.length;
  for (i = x; i > -1; i--) {
    result.push(newarr[i]);
  }
  str = result.join("");
  return str;
}
reverseString("Bloc!");

2. 
CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
   ENTER queue array
   CALL delete function
   FOR to loop elements in the array
   PUSH elements to the array
   CALL .pop to delete the last element
   RETURN new array
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS

3. 
CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
 THEN push items(element)
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
THEN shift items()
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
